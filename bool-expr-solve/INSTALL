== INSTALLATION ==

To build all parts this project, run the following command:

	make all

This generates the bin/ directory, which contains the compiled Java class files, and the boolsolve shell script, which acts as a wrapper around the java command.  This also happens to be the default target for make.  To remove these binary files, run:

	make clean

This removes the bin/ directory and the boolsolve shell script.  To generate Javadoc documentation:

	make javadoc

And to remove the documentation:

	make cleandoc

The following builds only the class files:

	make BooleanExpressionSolver

And this builds only the shell script:

	make boolsolve
